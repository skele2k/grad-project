[Sector number] [Frequency] [Acess Time Interval Average] [Total # of block written] [Hot/Cold]
Frequency means total access to the Sector Number.
Acess Time Interval Average is in nanoseconds in train data and seconds in test data.
Hot data is labeled 1. Cold data is labeled 0.
                                                           
ex. 8488 966 36.0808 7728 1
sector number 8488 is accessed 966 times. With interval average of 36.0808 seconds(or nanoseconds).
Overall # of written block is 7728 so overall 7728 * 512 = 3956736byte.
